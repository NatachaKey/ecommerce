//calculate the average rating and the number of reviews for a specific product and update the corresponding Product document
//here we call calculateAverageRating (static method) on Schema using .statics // with .methods we call erth on instance -see comparePassword in User Schema)

If we pass in null or a constant value (like 1), it will just group all the results together. In this case, we've already filtered the results in the first aggregate step to give us just the reviews for a particualr product; we're then grouping together all of those reviews, and doing some calculations / "aggregations" on those groups (to get the average rating and number of reviews).
        _id: null, //  id of the group- can be product id, rating, etc //we use null or _id: '$product' // but  if we want to calculate how many reviews we have with specific rating for this product: _id : '$rating'  //check syntax  + add: ,amount:{$sum:1}- see code below line 81

      { _id: productId }, // Find the product with the specified productId

        averageRating: Math.ceil(result[0]?.averageRating || 0), // Update averageRating field/ sets the averageRating field to the rounded average rating value from the aggregation result (result[0]?.averageRating). result[0]?.averageRating: This part accesses the averageRating property of the first element (result[0]) in the result array. The ?. optional chaining operator is used to prevent a runtime error if result[0] is undefined or null. If averageRating exists, it will be used for further calculations. if not it will be set to 0
        numOfReviews: result[0]?.numOfReviews || 0, // Update numOfReviews field/ sets the averageRating field to the rounded average rating value from the aggregation result (result[0]?.averageRating)

//post save hook called- on save()
